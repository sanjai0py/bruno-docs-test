## GIT Integration in Bruno Overview

### Open-source version

In the open-source version of Bruno, users need to manually perform GIT operations using the terminal or tools like [VS Code's GIT](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview) features. This includes initializing a GIT repository, adding changes, committing, pushing, and pulling updates. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to use GIT with Bruno in the open-source version.

### Initializing GIT in Bruno collection

To begin version controlling your Bruno collection, you need to initialize a GIT repository in the directory where your `.bru` files are stored using the following steps:

1. **Navigate to the Bruno Collection Location:**

   - First, navigate to the location on your PC where you created the Bruno collection. Once you're there, copy the path.

2. **Change directory in Terminal:**

   - Head over to the terminal and run the following command:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/bruno/collection
     ```
     This will place you inside the Bruno collection.

3. **Initialize Git:**
   - Now, initialize Git in the Bruno collection directory by running the following command:

     ```bash
     git init
     ```

     This step marks the beginning of the magical journey of version control for your collection.

With these commands successfully executed, your Bruno collection is now prepared to engage in seamless collaborations using any preferred version control system. Let your creativity flow without the worries of versioning!
