## GIT Integration in Bruno Overview

### Open-source version

In the open-source version of Bruno, users need to manually perform GIT operations using the terminal or tools like VS Code's GIT features. This includes initializing a GIT repository, adding changes, committing, pushing, and pulling updates. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to use GIT with Bruno in the open-source version.

### Initializing GIT in Bruno collection

To begin version controlling your Bruno collection, you need to initialize a GIT repository in the directory where your `.bru` files are stored using the following steps:

1. **Navigate to the Bruno Collection Location:**

   - Navigate to the location on your PC where you created the Bruno collection, and copy the path.

2. **Change directory in Terminal:**

   - Run the following command in the terminal:
     ```
     cd path/to/your/bruno/collection
     ```

3. **Initialize Git:**
   - Run the following command to initialize Git in the Bruno collection directory:
     ```
     git init
     ```

### Adding and Committing Changes

After initializing the GIT repository, you can add and commit changes to your collection.

1. **Creating a New HTTP Request in Bruno App**

   - Hover over the collection name in the Bruno app.
   - Click on the three dots, then click on "New Request."
   - Type in the name of the request and populate the URL field with `https://example.com`.
   - After making the change, save it.

2. **Adding and committing the changes**
   - Stage all the changes made inside the collection:
     ```
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit the changes:
     ```
     git commit -m "Created my first Bruno request üê∂"
     ```

### Pushing and Pulling Changes

To share your changes with others, you can push and pull your commits to/from a remote repository.

1. **Pushing changes**

   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Pulling changes**
   ```
   git pull origin main
   ```
